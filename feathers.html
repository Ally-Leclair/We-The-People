            <h2>Feathers</h2>
            <p>In the book, Kya’s family leaves her to her own devices when she is at a very important developmental stage in her life. Because of this, she only attended school for a day and she doesn’t really fit in with the society that is just outside of the marsh she lives in. Before she can even read or write, she takes a special interest in collecting and learning about feathers, shells, insects, and other specimens. Kya makes her first real friend because he leaves feathers on a stump for her to collect. These feathers represent the connection between Kya and Tate, as well as the rest of society. Everyone else in the town is as intrigued by her as she is with the feathers. They also treat her and view her as a specimen that is unlike them.</p>
