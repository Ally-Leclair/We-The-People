            <h2>Shell Necklace</h2>
            <p>On her first “date” with Chase Andrews, he gives Kya a seashell, which she later makes into a necklace to give to him. Despite reservations about the way he pushes her comfort levels and how much more experience he has in relationships than she does, she gives it to him anyways. This necklace represents a piece of her that she was giving to him. Chase wore this necklace all of the time, even when he got married to someone else. The necklace was a trophy to him, a prize he had won because he was the one who took the innocence of the “marsh girl”. When Chase ends up dead, the shell necklace was missing from around the neck of his body, and that’s how Kya was connected to the crime. Though she was acquitted of commiting the murder, it is later revealed that she had the necklace. She had taken the piece of herself she had given Chase back.</p>
