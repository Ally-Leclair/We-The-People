            <h3>Survival</h3>
            <p id="theme">
                In the book Kya is left to survive on her own, because of this she possesses an intuitive connection to the creatures of the marsh and the marsh itself. Due to her upbringing, Kya feels as though she is part of the ecosystem of the marsh rather than the town near it. Kya’s survival instincts come out in full force by the end of the book. We learn how being raised by nature has affected Kya’s worldview. In Kya’s world we learn that there is neither good nor evil, only survival at its most animalistic. Throughout the book we see Kya grow into that mindset through isolation and abandonment.

But suddenly the female firefly reached up, grabbed him with her mouth, and ate him, chewing all six legs and both wings...Kya knew judgment had no place here. Evil was not in play, just life pulsing on, even at the expense of some of the players. Biology sees right and wrong as the same color in different light.”</p>

            <h3>Independence vs human connection</h3>
            <p id="theme">
                Throughout the novel we see Kya struggle between being an independent, free spirit and human connection. She desperately wants to feel connected to the other people around her. Despite the pain and eventual fear of abandonment that these relationships bring Kya she still tries to make them. Eventually, however, we see Kya give up on connecting with people at all as she turns her attention to the marsh and her own survival. Throughout the novel, Kya goes between human connection, total isolation and a strange mix of the two.

            <p id="quote">“Please don't talk to me about isolation. No one has to tell me how it changes a person. I have lived it. I am isolation," Kya whispered with a slight edge.”</p>

            <h3>Growing Up</h3>
            <p id="theme">
                This novel showcases a journey into adulthood. Kya starts off the novel as a seven year old child. She faces abandonment from this age until she is about nineteen. As she grows older, the only constant in her life is the marsh she lives in. Where The Crawdads Sing is just as much a coming of age story as it is a murder-mystery. As we learn details of the murder, we get to learn who Kya is and her mindstate. We also learn how her years of isolation shaped her mindset to one of pure survival. She fights through love, loss, isolation, prejudice and the realities of growing up.

            <p id="quote">“Sometimes she heard night-sounds she didn't know or jumped from lightning too close, but whenever she stumbled, it was the land who caught her. Until at last, at some unclaimed moment, the heart-pain seeped away like water into sand. Still there, but deep. Kya laid her hand upon the breathing, wet earth, and the marsh became her mother.”</p>
            <p id="quote">“Kya never had her troop of close friends, nor the connections Jodie described, for she never had her own family. She knew the years of isolation had altered her behavior until she was different from others, but it wasn’t her fault she’d been alone. Most of what she knew, she’d learned from the wild. Nature had nurtured, tutored, and protected her when no one else would. If consequences resulted from her behaving differently, then they too were functions of life’s fundamental core.”</p>

            <h3>prejudice</h3>
            <p id="theme">
                The people around Kya are not accepting of people different then themselves. Kya comes from a poor background because of this, people have shunned her from the town all her life to the point she doesn't even go to school. In the courtroom a big point the defense makes is that the town has always made assumptions about Kya and have never given her a chance. She is eventually given a secound chance because the townspeople feel bad about how they have treated her. The only people who treat Kya with respect are Jumpin’ and Mable who themselves are looked down upon for being African-American.

            <p id="quote">"Yet in reality, she was only an abandoned child, a little girl surviving on her own in a swamp, hungary and cold, but we didn't help her. Except for one of her only friends, Jumpin', not one of our churches or community groups offered her food or clothes. Instead we labled and rejected her because we thought she was diffrent. But, ladies and gentelmen, did we exclude Miss Clark because she was diffrent, or was she diffrent because we excluded her?"</p>

            <h3>The Natural World Vs. The Manmade World</h3>
            <p id="theme">
                In the book we see a robust world in the marsh. Given Delia Owens background, the marsh Kya lives in feels alive. We have beautiful descriptions of the marsh as it teems with life. In comparison the cold manmade courtroom seems unnatural for Kya to be in. She is uncomfortable in the sterile environment of the courtroom. In the courtroom Kya experiences isolation, which she knows well, but does not get to enjoy the benefits of being alone. She yearns for the outdoors and her own freedom.

            <p id="quote">“Autumn leaves don’t fall; they fly. They take their time and wander on this, their only chance to soar.”</p>
            <p id="quote">“It happens in humans, too. Some behaviors that seem harsh to us now ensured the survival of early man in whatever swamp he was in at the time. Without them, we wouldn't be here. We still store those instincts in our genes, and they express themselves when certain circumstances prevail. Some parts of us will always be what we were, what we had to be to survive-way back yonder.”</p>

            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p id="theme">
                Delia Owens makes a point about the education of the natural world being just as beautiful and important as formal education. Tate and Kya bond over a shared love of nature and the study of it. Tate teaches Kya the power of words, which grows Kya’s love of learning. In her later years she studies the marsh and even becomes a recognized poet. The “marsh girl”, a creature rumored as the missing link between ape and man, connects with people through the power of the pen entirely self taught. Kya’s world is different from those around her, so her education is too.

            <h3>Love</h3>
            <p id="themes">
                We are given many examples of love in Where The Crawdads Sing. At the very beginning, we get a look at Kya’s parents' toxic relationship. From there Kya meets Tate who is technically supposed to be a healthy and positive influence for Kya (debatable). He is meant to symbolize first love, born from shared interest. After Tate leaves, Chase Andrews represents another type of toxic love. From these examples, Owens gives us outlets to examine the relationships in our own lives.
            </p>
            <p id="quote">“I must let go now. Let you go. Love is too often The answer for staying. Too seldom the reason For going. I drop the line And watch you drift away. “All along You thought The fiery current Of your lover’s breast Pulled you to the deep. But it was my heart-tide Releasing you To float adrift With seaweed.”</p>
